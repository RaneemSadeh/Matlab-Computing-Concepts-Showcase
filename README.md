## ðŸ§  Core Concepts Explored

- **Number Theory & Cryptography**
  - Implements the **RSA algorithm** to illustrate public-key encryption using prime numbers.

- **Probability & Hashing**
  - Compares **Modular Arithmetic** and **Truncation-based** hashing for load balancing.

- **Coordinate Geometry**
  - Uses 2D plotting to draw complex shapes using geometric functions.

### Task 1: RSA Encryption Algorithm

Implements the **RSA public-key encryption** scheme.

#### Steps:

1. Choose two prime numbers:
   ```matlab
   p = 23;
   q = 17;
